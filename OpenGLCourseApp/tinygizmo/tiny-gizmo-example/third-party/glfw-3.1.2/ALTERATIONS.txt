In compliance with requirement 2 of the GLFW license, this file
describes alterations that have been made to this distribution of
GLFW.

This folder uses a subset of the sources provided in the GLFW 3.1.2
distribution from www.glfw.org. A Visual Studio 2013 project has
been generated that is mostly equivalent to the output of the 
official CMake scripts, except that it supports both the Win32 and
x64 platforms.

For the official, up-to-date sources, please visit www.glfw.org.
